# i18nl10n
A module to handle localizations for Contao

**Note: Please be aware, that I'm currently hiking New Zealand and therefore not able to work on new issues.**

On default you need multiple pagetrees to create a multilingual website in Contao 3, where each tree handles exactly 1 language. If you have many pages and languages it can become a lot of work to handle your content and to keep them in sync.

The i18nl10n extension lets you handle your content in an easier way.
