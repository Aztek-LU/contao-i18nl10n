# i18nl10n
A module to handle localizations for Contao

**I'm looking for a new programmer for this module, since I have very little time left at the moment to work on it myself and I'm not working in the Contao field anymore :( - Please contact me at www.derverstaerker.ch if interested.**

On default you need multiple pagetrees to create a multilingual website in Contao 3, where each tree handles exactly 1 language. If you have many pages and languages it can become a lot of work to handle your content and to keep them in sync.

The i18nl10n extension lets you handle your content in an easier way.
